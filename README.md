Microservices Health Orchestrator

A Python-based intelligent system that monitors microservices health and automatically performs healing actions like restarts, scaling, or rerouting using machine learning.

Problem Statement

Design a container and microservices **Health Orchestrator** that:
- Monitors service metrics (CPU, memory, response time)
- Predicts failures using AI/ML
- Applies automated healing (restart, scale, reroute)
- Maintains modularity with clear architecture

Skills Demonstrated

- **AI/ML**: Logistic Regression-based failure prediction
- **Automation**: Automated healing with scaling/restarts
- **Critical Thinking**: Handles cascading failures and dependenci
